# SwipeFurPet

SwipeFurPet is a pet adoption web app that's inspired by Tinder.

The basic idea is users and shelters can sign up. Users sign up for pets they would like to adopt, shelters sign up to register their pets for adoption.

The shelters info is verified through PetFinder's API (Shelter ID). The project was created for USC CSCI 201's Final Project.

The project's documentations is in `Final Document.pdf`

This project is done in collaboration with Jae Shim, Mei Zhang, Xi Liu, and Hannah Oh.

## Things can be done better:
* Unifed layout and coding style -- As of the project's submission, the main swiping interface is coded via React. However due to the size of file and improper management of the React App (200 MB), it's not uploaded here. The React's app functionality is to implement swiping animations with new pets

* Have full implementation of matching algorithm for pets and users. The implementation was incomplete due to time crunch

* Clean up files
